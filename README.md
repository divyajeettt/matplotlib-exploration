## About matplotlib-exploration

This repository contains simple projects/scripts that explore the simplest features of Python's [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/). These include:
- 2-dimensional plotting
- 3-dimensional plotting
- Live-data plotting
- 2-dimensional parametrized plotting
- Plotting in polar coordinates

## Future Plans

Although some of my other projects do use these features, it would ne nice to add the following to this repository:
- Add [sub-plots](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplot.html)
- Add 3-dimensional paramtrized plotting
